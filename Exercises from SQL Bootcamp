--These are some questions we were given from the SQL Bootcamp on Udemy by Jose Portilla. 

--How many payment transactions were greater than $5.00?
SELECT COUNT(amount) FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5.00;

--How many actors have a first name that starts with the letter P?
SELECT COUNT(actor_id) FROM actor 
WHERE first_name LIKE 'P%';

--How many unique districts are our customers from?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(district)) FROM address;

--Now find the names of the districts, and sort them in alphabetical order.
SELECT DISTINCT(district) AS dist FROM address
ORDER BY dist;

--How many films have a rating of R and a replacement cost between $5 and $15?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film 
WHERE rating = 'R'
AND replacement_cost BETWEEN 5 AND 15;

--How many films have the word Truman somewhere in the title?
SELECT title FROM film 
WHERE title ILIKE '%Truman%';

/*There are 2 staff members, with staff IDs 1 and 2. 
They want to give a bonus to the staff member that handled the most payments. 
(The most number of payments processed, not total dollar amount.) 
How many payments did each staff member handle, and who gets the bonus? */

SELECT staff_id, COUNT(amount) FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id;

--Staff ID 1 got 7292, and Staff ID 2 got 7304, so Staff ID 2 wins the bonus

/*Corporate HQ is conducting a study on the relationship between replacement cost and a movie MPAA rating (ex. G, PG, R, etc).
What is the average replacement cost per MPAA rating? */
Note: I will be rounding to 2 decimal places.
SELECT rating, ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost),2) AS replace_cost FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

/* They are running a promotion to reward their top 5 customers with coupons. 
What are the customer IDs of the top 5 customers by total spend? */
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) FROM payment 
GROUP BY customer_id 
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;

/* They are launching a platinum service for the most loyal customers. 
They will assign platinum status to customers that have had 40 or more transaction payments. 
What customer IDs are eligible for platinum status? */
